# heart-rate-from-videos

This code is used to extract the heart rate from an individual using only a short video clip of the individual. This concept was used in the video calling device. The code to take a short video and amplify the skin tone variations to reveal the heartbeat. I wanted to use this concept of medical sensing without physical contact, and implemented the MIT code. The code provided by them creates an output video. Further code is needed to extract the heart rate using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This code was written to take the center fifth of the frame and average the intensity of red pixels in that region. This information is then processed to find the dominant frequency which can be read as the individual's heart rate. Further improvements can be made by incorporating image stabilization or face tracking, but for our purpose these were not necessary.
